# market-cabbage-stock-simulation
Market cabbage stock simulation written in Python and demonstrated on Jupyter Notebook. Job is to simulate the shop for rotting cabbages scenario, and again do the optimal stock size experiments (decide on the optimal stock level of cabbages to keep the number of expired cabbages to a minimum while maintaining the number of customers unable to find a cabbage in stock to 3 in 1000 or less). Recall that: cabbages go rotten in 7-12 days, are delivered in 1-15 days, and shoppers looking to buy cabbage come every 0-3 days (you may assume these are uniformly distributed).
